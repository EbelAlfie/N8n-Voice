# Welcome to the Abyss.. Where soul perist while AI persist
A simple integration with customer (you), AI customer service, and human customer service voice calling with N8N. The customer (you) will first talk to the AI about stuff they need to know, then the customer may request to call a real customer service and the AI will create a call between you and the customer service (Note, you must have two devices or optionaly, friends that acts as a customer service)

This is the clients side that could act either as customer (you) or a customer service (your device/friend)

## Manual
- Press the talk to start talking to the AI. The AI will send it's response through websocket and talks through the TextToSpeech
- Say for example "I want to call customer service" to make the AI create a call between you and the customer service
- After that, you and your friend will redirect to ringing call screen and talk to each other
